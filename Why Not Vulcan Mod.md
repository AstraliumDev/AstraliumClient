# Why we're not using [VulcanMod](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod) at the moment?
- In fact, we are glad that the community is actively developing and improving in this game. We also try to do this for our users and not only ours, but for all users in Minecraft. However, at the moment Vulcan Mod has conflict situations with all the necessary mods for most players. In addition, it doesn't work correctly on all systems. Using the example of my laptop based on Linux OS with Risen 7 5800H, AMD Vega 8 (Integrated GPU), RTX 3060 Max-Q, Minecraft with AMD Vega 8 works at 300 FPS without a [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric), with a [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric) even more up to 400-500 FPS, but with VulcanMod fps no higher than 150 FPS, perhaps this is a conflict of smth on my device
