### Why SOPP ModPack Client
- Using our client, you do not risk losing performance, unless you have too old hardware in your PC / Laptop, but in this case I can direct you to study the minimum characteristics. However, I will still try to help you on my discord channel.

### The main advantages of the SOPP client mod-pack

- The mod-pack client completely changes the processing of light in the game due to the StarLight mod (By Tuinity developer), which significantly increases the speed of generating chunks and loading the world on the client side, as well as if the mod is on the server side
With Sodium, Sodium & Iris, you get the best optimization in the game. Optifine is not very good :)

- In addition to optimizing the game itself, you get a decrease in RAM usage when playing, as well as an accelerated launch of the game (This may not have the full effect if you have a very weak PC or laptop!)

# Popular Questions

### Where OptiFine in SOPP ModPack Client?
- We are not using OptiFine as it conflicts with many mods from other developers for Fabric Loader
Ideal alternative is Sodium or even Iris & Sodium (Shader support in the latter :))
### OptiFine Edition
- First added to SOPPv15ROF-STAR. It still has very good optimization due to other mods (Starlight, Hydrogen for example and others). As before, OptiFine with shaders shows very poor performance. 
- We do not support Optifine 100% at the moment. This is an open source add-on. Optifine can increase FPS without shaders, powerful particle effects, etc ... But still RSI is the main way to improve the performance of your game

### Do you have any plans for a SOPP port for Forge?

- Unfortunately, this is ruled out, since Forge Loader does not provide an opportunity to optimize it perfectly (At least as it is possible if you used Fabric Loader :))
But for some who need help with Forge, I can help in my discord channel.

### Do you have builds for 1.16.5?

- Yes, you can download them on our discord channel. 1.16.5 and all previous builds after the release of new versions Minecraft will be under the brand name outdated/no longer support
