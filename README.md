### Why Astralium Client ModPack Client
- Using our client, you do not risk losing performance, unless you have too old hardware in your PC / Laptop, but in this case I can direct you to study the minimum characteristics. However, I will still try to help you on my discord channel.

### The main advantages of the Astralium Client

- The mod-pack client completely changes the processing of light in the game due to the StarLight mod (By Tuinity developer), which significantly increases the speed of generating chunks and loading the world on the client side, as well as if the mod is on the server side
With Sodium, Sodium & Iris, you get the best optimization in the game. Optifine is not very good :)

- In addition to optimizing the game itself, you get a decrease in RAM usage when playing, as well as an accelerated launch of the game (This may not have the full effect if you have a very weak PC or laptop!)

# Popular Questions

### Where OptiFine in SOPP ModPack Client?
- We are not using OptiFine as it conflicts with many mods from other developers for Fabric Loader
Ideal alternative is Sodium or even Iris & Sodium (Shader support in the latter :))
### OptiFine Edition
- First added to SOPPv15ROF-STAR. It still has very good optimization due to other mods (Starlight, Hydrogen for example and others). As before, OptiFine with shaders shows very poor performance. 
- We do not support Optifine 100% at the moment. This is an open source add-on. Optifine can increase FPS without shaders, powerful particle effects, etc ... But still RSI is the main way to improve the performance of your game

### Do you have any plans for a SOPP port for Forge?

- Unfortunately, this is ruled out, since Forge Loader does not provide an opportunity to optimize it perfectly (At least as it is possible if you used Fabric Loader :))



# SOPP Addons 
### LFire Addon 
- Improves visibility when you burn and in general the fire on the block becomes less than the original
### HDShield Addon
- Improves shields, making them an HD model (For example, applied drawing patterns)
### 3D Addon
- Improves the quality of some models, for example: Pointed Dripstone, StoneCutter, Ladders, Chains and other similar models
### LParticles Addon
- Reduces some particles in PvP and softens campfire smoke
### LWeather Addon
- Reduces the number of particles during snowfall and rain
### DarkGUI Addon
- Makes a simple dark theme for inventory, action buttons
